# Getting started with Clarity Design System

Clarity is an open-source, enterprise-focused design system with a core design principle of inclusion.

Clarityâ€™s designs stem from continuous exploration and research. These designs are built into our web components and can be used any web application, regardless of the underlying JavaScript framework. Clarity also offers a set of well-designed and implemented data-bound components built on top of Angular, one of the most popular JavaScript frameworks in the industry.

If you are new to Clarity, we suggest using Clarity's web component implemenation, as this version of our components is the long term vision for Clarity. The existing Clarity Angular components are still stable and supported, but are no longer receiving feature enhancements as we work towards fully realizing the Clarity Core web components as the replacement the Clarity Angular component implementations.

## How to get started

- Chrome
- Safari
- Firefox
- Edge (Chromium based)

_Note that Clarity only actively supports the latest two versions of the listed browsers._

## Screen Reader Support

Clarity is tested across several sets of screen reader and browser combinations against the WCAG 2.1 spec. The testing has identified the two combinations that enable us to provide support when fixing issues related to the various assistive technologies available to users. The following are the primary combinations that we focus on when addressing issues on the Windows and macOS platforms:

- NVDA + Google Chrome (Windows)
- VoiceOver + Safari (Apple)

_The latest version of both screen reader and browser is used when testing issues and WCAG 2.1 compliance._
